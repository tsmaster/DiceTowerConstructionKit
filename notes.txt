a quarter sphere shell as a simple approach to a dice tower

a cylinder around the base as a "corral"

random holes and bumps to make the dice tumble unpredictably



----------

New! Modular Stackable Stovepipe Design

with a rim rail mounting, can assemble a bunch of modules to make a new tower each time.

Modules:

[ ] Larger base (non circle)

[x] Ramp - an inclined plane on one (2?) sides of the tube

[x] Propellor - an inclined plane pushing dice tangentially

[ ] Beam - just a simple strut across a radius (chord?)
  
  [x] triangular cross section

  [ ] semicircle (for Darryl)

  [ ] louver
  
[ ] Funnel - push the dice toward the center

  [X] Cone Funnel - funnel with a circular hole

  [ ] polygon funnel - funnel with a parametric number of sides

  [ ] torus funnel - funnel made from a torus

  [ ] particle vortex funnel - funnel made by carving particle paths out of a solid

[ ] Offset Funnel - as above, but offset

[ ] funnel with "net" mesh funnel

[ ] Curvy Blade - like a beam, but with a concave up cross section across the blade, concave down along the blade

[ ] juicer - like an orange juicer, but dice come out, not juice

[x] chain - a tube with a print-in-place chain across the tube

[X] null tube - just a tube

[ ] receiver - corral section, deflector ramp

  [X] ramp rcv - flat deflector

  [ ] rcv with sphere deflector

  [ ] rcv with scoop (cylinder) deflector

[ ] tube with internal screws (like the inside of a nut)

[x] spiral staircase

[ ] through-holes for chopsticks / pencils 

[ ] decorative inside

  [ ] pit of hands, like in Labyrinth

  [ ] pit of faces

  [ ] pit of fiddles

[ ] decorative outside

  [ ] looking like a stained glass window, flying buttresses

  [ ] hexagons, regular

  [ ] hexagons, scattered (random?)

  [ ] procedural (blue noise) circular holes

  [ ] diamonds
