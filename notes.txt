a quarter sphere shell as a simple approach to a dice tower

a cylinder around the base as a "corral"

random holes and bumps to make the dice tumble unpredictably



----------

New! Modular Stackable Stovepipe Design

with a rim rail mounting, can assemble a bunch of modules to make a new tower each time.

Modules:

[x] Larger base (non circle)

[x] Ramp - an inclined plane on one (2?) sides of the tube

[x] Propellor - an inclined plane pushing dice tangentially

[ ] Beam - just a simple strut across a radius (chord?)
  
  [x] triangular cross section

  [ ] semicircle (for Darryl)

  [ ] louver
  
[ ] Funnel - push the dice toward the center

  [X] Cone Funnel - funnel with a circular hole

  [ ] polygon funnel - funnel with a parametric number of sides

  [ ] torus funnel - funnel made from a torus

  [ ] particle vortex funnel - funnel made by carving particle paths out of a solid

[ ] Offset Funnel - as above, but offset

[ ] funnel with "net" mesh funnel

[ ] Curvy Blade - like a beam, but with a concave up cross section across the blade, concave down along the blade

[x] juicer - like an orange juicer, but dice come out, not juice

[x] chain - a tube with a print-in-place chain across the tube

[X] null tube - just a tube

[ ] receiver - corral section, deflector ramp

  [X] ramp rcv - flat deflector

  [ ] rcv with sphere deflector

  [ ] rcv with scoop (cylinder) deflector

[ ] tube with internal screws (like the inside of a nut)

[x] spiral staircase

[ ] through-holes for chopsticks / pencils 

[ ] decorative inside

  [ ] pit of hands, like in Labyrinth

  [ ] pit of faces

  [ ] pit of fiddles

[ ] decorative outside

  [ ] looking like a stained glass window, flying buttresses

  [ ] hexagons, regular

  [ ] hexagons, scattered (random?)

  [ ] procedural (blue noise) circular holes

  [ ] diamonds

TODO (May 26, 2019)

There are several things I want to fix, now that I've printed about 10
modules.

The big one is restricting the contents of tubes to not extend into
the top "rim" area, as this makes it difficult to stack modules. It
may also make it difficult for dice to pass from module to module, but
that's a lesser concern, and can to some degree be handled by the user
at the table.

Other notes of fixes:

[x] make funnel mouth larger

[x] make funnel wall thinner

[x] make chain an even number of links so the anchors don't both face the same way.

[x] add central pillar to spiral staircase

[x] re-export all modules with the rim non-encroachment

  [x] beam

  [x] chain

  [x] funnel

  [x] propellor

  [x] ramp

  [x] spiral staircase
